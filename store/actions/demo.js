As good space but only could work if attached to our ceiling as wall has a pocket door behind it so no way to mount to wall. Was so happy to find this on Etsy. Will take out wood & stain & varnish soon but had to put my stuff on it yesterday after it got hung! Love it!'

Having the ability to order different lengths was helpful. Installation was easy, with smaller holes needed than other brackets. This made for a seamless install.
