        h3.secTitle ABOUT US
        p.fontSerif &quot;We have flipped many houses. During these renovations, we lived in each home for at least a year. Therefore we wanted to make the house feel like our home while we were there. However, we had to avoid hurting the resale value while we were adding our personality to the space. We ultimately found out that the best way to showcase our personality while keeping a timeless design is through shelving.
        p.fontSerif The problem was, the shelving units offered online, didn&apos;t fit our space correctly or were simply poor quality. We needed something custom but we didn&apos;t have time to wait months for someone to create it. In addition, we didn&apos;t know if it would actually turn out the way we wanted. This led me to come up with my own designs for shelving. Thankfully for me, my husband -Austin- is an engineer and born craftsman- so he could build anything I designed with ease.
        p.fontSerif We tried the normal floating shelves (concealed bracket), which were fine, Austin even created a bracket for these that many carpenters swear by. However, we always preferred incorporating statement shelving (with brackets that are meant to be seen) because these units doubled as a timeless work of art. We found that this type of shelving made homes standout and received compliments from anyone who saw it.
        p.fontSerif We realized others needed access to customizable, statement shelving, so we created Iron Abode. Now anyone can easily customize their own metal, glass or wood statement shelving on our website. They also have access to our team of designers and shelving experts who will answer all questions along the way.&quot;
